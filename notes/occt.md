- graphical solutions
	- component for visualization of 2D and 3D data
	- rapid development
- capabilities
	- visualization 
	- selection
- domains
	- precision optics
	- machining
	- computed tomography to aviation
	- ship building
	- plant design and BIM (through the IFC file format)
- input data
	- data exchange modules
- key features
	- open architecture and can be adapted through its API.
	- native support for OCCT CAD data
	- native support for other typical elements of a 3D scene (meshes, textures, axes, color scale, dimensions, text labels, lines and markers).
	- low-level graphic renderer: OpenGL and GLSL graphics API
	- is fully compatible with desktop and mobile graphics (OpenGL ES). 
	- runs on cross platforms: Windows, Linux, OS X, Android and iOS.	
	- other graphics API is available: Microsoft D3D,Â With ANGLE project.	
	- includes state-of-the-art algorithms: 
		- interactive selection based on efficient acceleration structures (Bounding Volumes Hierarchy, BVH)
		- efficient CPU-side presentation culling
		- ray tracing and path tracing.	
	- supports common types of stereoscopic rendering, is ready for fast integration with virtual reality (VR) applications and systems.
